🚀 Getting Started

If you'd like to run this locally:

npm install
npm run dev


Make sure your environment supports React + Tailwind (e.g., Vite, Create React App, or Next.js).

🙌 Author's Note

This project was built under time constraints and focused primarily on visual UI fidelity and component structure. Given more time, I’d expand functionality with live Web3 integrations (e.g., wallet connect, real NFT metadata, OpenSea APIs, live ETH prices via CoinGecko or similar).
